==============
Jygsaw is a graphics library for Jython which makes graphics programming easy
to learn. At the same time, it's flexible and extensible, making it ideal for
beginners and experienced programmers alike.

Jygsaw takes many cues from the Processing language, but it uses Python,
which is a powerful, dynamic programming language with clear and readable
syntax, and runs on the Java Virtual Machine, making it portable.
